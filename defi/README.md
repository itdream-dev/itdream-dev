### **3. Delve into the Source Code of Leading Protocols**

Many DeFi projects currently interrelate and combine, with some leading DeFi protocols forming the cornerstone of complex DeFi combinations. Hence, mastering the implementation of these DeFi initiatives is critical. After an initial understanding of DeFi's workings through protocol documentation, further comprehension can be achieved by studying the complete source code to grasp specific logic and economic models.

### **4. DeFi Economic Models**

The economic model is a core component of DeFi products, so it's essential to understand the risks associated with these models. Throughout the learning process, one should develop and consolidate their perspectives and methodologies.
